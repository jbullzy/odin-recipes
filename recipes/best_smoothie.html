        <h2>About this dish</h2>
            <p>This is still the best smoothie recipe I've come up with. Low cal but it fills you with goodness. Careful with this one.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups frozen blueberries <em>or</em> Berry Medley</li>
                <li>Almond Milk</li>
                <li>A scoop of your favorite protein powder</li>
                <li>Cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of Peanut Butter <em>or</em> Almond Butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add your frozen blueberries and almond milk to the blender. The key is getting this ratio right - you want the almond milk to <em>barely</em> cover the frozen fruit.</li>
                <li>Add your Protein powder, a dash of cinnamon, and your peanut butter to the mix. Blend it up.</li>
                <li>Add almond milk as needed until you get the perfect consistency. It should be thick enough to scoop, but smooth enough to drink through a straw.</li>
                <li>Enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
