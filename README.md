Creating a recipe website using HTML. Part of The Odin Project. 

For this project, I'll be using HTML to create a bare-bones website for recipes. 
By the end of this, I'll hope to have demonstrated proficiency in HTML syntax, which includes but isn't limited to:

    - Basic HTML boilerplate structure
    - Titles
    - Paragraphs
    - Basic text manipulation (bold, italicize)
    - Nesting elements
    - Lists 
    - Links
    - Images
    - File structure
